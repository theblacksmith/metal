# Karma config samples


This folder contains 3 config file samples for Karma. `karma-unit.tpl.js` came from [ng-boilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ng-boilerplate), `karma.conf.js` and `karma-e2e.conf.js` the other two came from [yeoman angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).

We should use the code in this samples to setup our testing environment.
